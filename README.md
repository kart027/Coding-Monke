Category: Generic API based Web programming Assumptions: 
• Real email is not needed, if could be simulated on Web page just for demo purpose. • It should be small size emails <1 MB, no attachment. 
• Per Day emails: 500 Use cases: 
• Design and build a bulk email notification system to draft, compile and send to email notification providers. 
• Bulk email should be based on pre-defined templates. 
• Bulk email alerts can be scheduled to send on a specific time. 
• Bulk emails should be prioritized and sent based on priority. 
• Example: system outage notification to all employees.
    Explanation:
1. First and foremost, we designed and developed the structure and user interface of 
our web document.
2. To achieve our goal of bulk mailing, we have used a node js in which we send a 
message in a predefined template (which is changeable according to user 
convenience) to all of the recipients in our recipients list.
3. The user can send the desired email to as many recipients as they want.
4. The mail that is to be sent can be scheduled for the time that the user wishes to send 
it.
5. Furthermore, our application supports multiple scheduling, which means we can 
send multiple emails at different times.
6. When the scheduled time for the email arrives, the email is sent to all recipients.
7. As a result, we achieve our goal of bulk mailing and mail scheduling
